### Installing in Linux
1. Read the readme.md file.

2. Download the program files.
> https://github.com/BV5Tl0N/TheDupe/new/main/Linux-x64
3. Extract to a directory where your account has write access.
4. Make the file an executable
> chmod +x TheDupe
5. Run the executable as sudo, once. This will create configuration and other necessary files.
> ./TheDupe
6. Update the configuration file.
7. Re-run the executable as sudo.
8. Test if the setup works by sending sample traffic to your honeypot then checking the logs.

**NOTE:** Any error would cause the executable to close. In this case, check the log for errors.
