3. Copy to a directory where your account has write access.
4. Run the executable as administrator, once. This will create configuration and other necessary files.
5. Update the configuration file.
6. Re-run the executable as administrator.
7. Test if the setup works by sending sample traffic to your honeypot then checking the logs.

**NOTE:** Any error would cause the executable to close. In this case, check the log for errors.
